## Some Recipes from the First Cookbooks Scanned

I have been diving into the image scanns for the first set of cookbooks selected for this project, and I wanted to share some interesting finds. Even though the goal of text analysis or "distant reading" is to analyze the full corpus for larger patterns, it is still important to get to know the texts in your corpus through close reading and develop an understanding of the context for the broader findings you may uncover. As each cookbook is scanned, I intend to look over each and keep a running list of interesting observations that I will use to shape the questions I ask and compare later to the results of the NLP analysis.
