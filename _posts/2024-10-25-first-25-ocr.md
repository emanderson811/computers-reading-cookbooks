## Selecting an OCR Engine
It will take a little over a semester for all 200 cookbooks to be scanned, so I decided to take the first 25 books scanned so far and test out my OCR and text pre-processing steps on them. This will allow me to see whether I have correctly planned the steps I’ll need to take with the full corpus to get meaningful results. 
Going into the project I had experience with and access to Tesseract OCR, an open-source commend line tool for converting images to machine-readable text, so I decided I would use that to create the .txt files I’ll need for analysis. When I first decided to use Tesseract I had tested a few scanned cookbooks and noticed that Tesseract struggled to recognize the fractions in ingredient lists, but otherwise seemed to do a pretty accurate job of handling the rest of the text. 

My colleague in Preservation who is managing digitization is also OCR-ing the texts as part of the digitization workflow we are testing for all digital collections. She is using ABBYY Finereader, a paid license product with a GUI. Since we’re using both products for different parts of the workflow and we have 25 completed, I now have more examples to compare to see if there is a significant difference in accuracy. With more examples to compare, I can now see a noticeable difference in how Tesseract and Finereader handle the table of contents and other non-standard text layouts as well as images and other “noise” on the page.

## Determining Pre-Processing Steps

No matter which OCR option I choose, there will inevitably be mistakes that produce extra punctuation, numerical characters, or unrecognizable characters in the text that will need to be cleaned before or ignored by Python during analysis. I'll be testing different options to determine how much advanced cleanup will be necessary to make sure these errors and extra characters don't muddy the analysis.
